# deeplearning_practice
This program is designed to test a convolutional neural network
based on VGG16. It allows you to enter a handwritten number or
open a file on your computer. After processing, the result
is displayed in the form of a processed image and a bar chart,
which shows the degree of "confidence" of the network
that the image corresponds to each of the 10 digits.


## Form
This is how an empty form looks like
